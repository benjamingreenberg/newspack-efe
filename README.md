# Newspack EFE Integrator

WordPress plugin that integrates the EFE news wire service with Newspack.
Currently the plugin exports articles from EFE's API to an xml file that can
be imported using a generic RSS feed importer Plugin.

A paid subscription from EFE is required for the Plugin to work.

This plugin is in the early stages of development, and should not be used in
production.
